# Calibre-and-DeDRM 
I am running Calibre 4.2 and DeDrm 6.8.  I download ebooks via Amazon and then in the Contents section I process the Transfir with USB and this creates a AZW3
file in my downloads.  The conversion process works for all AZW3 files downloaded prior to today (Sept 26), but any AZW3 loaded as of today receive the DRM error code from Calibre.
